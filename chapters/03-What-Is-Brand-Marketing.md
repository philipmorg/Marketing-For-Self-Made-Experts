# What Is Brand Marketing?

Brand marketing is art with a logo on it. Not the kind of art you'd find in a gallery. Instead, brand marketing is the kind of art that is a gift or a challenge to a specific culture.

A culture is a group of people with a shared identity. Seth Godin might call them a tribe.

We're going to look at brand marketing through the lens of tools and genre expectations. Like all art -- brand marketing is as much about the feel and nuance of how it's done as it is about specific objective qualities, so you may find my description of brand marketing less crisp and objective-sounding. This is a domain of subtleties, so bear with me.


## What is brand marketing?

Especially for consultants like us, what the heck actually _is_ brand marketing?

If you've ever been through an airport terminal -- at least here in the US -- you've certainly seen brand marketing from a big company like Accenture. You've seen those trying-really-hard-to-be-interesting posters. 

The ones this guy is making fun of here:

Or if you watched TV _at all_ in the 80's, you probably saw this campaign, from the US Army:

And most of us have seen the archetypical form of brand marketing, Superbowl commercials:

None of this stuff is what brand marketing for small consultancies looks like. But it _is_ all art with a logo on it.

Brand marketing for small-size consultancies is _also_ art with a logo on it. It is expensive relative to direct response marketing. It is potentially inefficient relative to direct response marketing. But it does not represent an expense on the scale of a Superbowl commercial. And -- critically -- brand marketing is not in tension with the expectations around expertise.

## Tools

As with direct response marketing, brand marketing tends to make use of a certain set of tools. As a quick reminder, the tools of direct response marketing are: Clear calls to action, forms, gated content assets, low-priced product(s) as segmentation mechanism, events as a front-end to promoting something, email sequences, long-form sales copy, moneyback guarantees, testimonials, and engineered pricing.

Here are the tools of brand marketing:

### Gifts

Have any of these lodged in your memory?

- A remarkable TED talk.
- A commercial, some part of which became conversational currency used among your friends (the [Budweiser Whassup? campaign](https://youtu.be/JJmqCKtJnxM) comes to mind here -- and skimming the ["In culture" section of the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whassup%3F) on that campaign is fascinating and relevant).
- Something else you didn't pay for, but created memorable value for you.

This is how brand marketing functions as a gift. It gives more than it takes. 

Direct response marketing "gifts" -- things like lead magnets and content upgrades and "free bonuses" bundled with info products -- are not given as freely. There's almost always the requirement of an email address in return, with the implication that you will be marketed to following providing your email address. Calling this arrangement a gift is pretty disingenuous.

Brand marketing, on the other hand, sometimes gives what could truly be thought of as gifts. Not always, of course. Some brand marketing efforts are not very good gifts. And some are just sloppy efforts at selling something under the guise of making a gift for the culture. But brand marketing generally trades in the currency of gifts.

In _our_ world, that of the small consultant, brand marketing gifts can look like the following:

- A talk where you share generously with no expectation of getting business directly from the talk
- Something like Basecamp's [free books](https://basecamp.com/books)
- Any book, in fact, where the ROI is dramatic
- A very good [podcast series](https://2bobs.com) 
- An email list like Corey Quinn's [Last Week in AWS](https://www.lastweekinaws.com)

A truly good gift is one we're delighted with because the giver combined their affection for us with creativity. This is true in brand marketing, and in life.

### Impactful experiences

One way in particular that you can give a gift to the group you serve is through an impactful experience. In fact, it's the _relevance_ and _impactful nature_ of gifts that make them valuable in the first place. Small, forgettable brand marketing gifts are small and forgettable because they weren't very relevant or impactful.

Here's an impactful experience from my life: reading Blair Enns' _The Win Without Pitching Manifesto_. At the time Blair published it as a series of pages on his website -- for free -- in addition to letting you pay for more convenient packagings of the book, so at the time I paid nothing for it. Yet, it totally rewired how I thought about certain things and inspired me to make some courageous choices. For Blair, publishing it was at least partially brand marketing work, and for me, reading it was an impactful experience.

### Reach & repetition

Brand marketing will seek to saturate our awareness. This happens by maximizing reach and making use of repetition.

In using the tools of reach and repetition, brand marketing may sacrifice focus. Trading away focus to gain reach would almost never happen (intentionally, anyway) with a direct response marketing campaign. In the direct response world, reaching "unresponsive" prospects would be seen as wasteful, and it would reduce some short-term oriented KPI.

A quick example that returns us to that tweet I showed at the top of the chapter: imagine that airlines made a practice of trying to identify passengers that are flying for business purposes. Maybe they segment their customer list, and look for those flying business class and/or those whose ticket seems to have been purchased by a business, and identify those folks as likely business travelers. (This doesn't sound like a farfetched a use of "data exhaust", does it?)

Accenture wants to reach business travelers. They have a choice. a) They can buy display ad space to have their brand marketing ads hung on the walls of airports. These posters and murals will certainly be seen by some business travelers and a lot of non-business travelers. Or, b) they can rent a list of business travelers from the airlines and directly contact those people, likely reaching a much higher percentage of business travelers. This is brand vs. direct response marketing. [^Although I'd argue the posters I've seen on airport walls aren't much of a gift and so aren't very good brand marketing.]

This is an interesting example because not every person who walks through an airport could possibly be an Accenture client. So by going with the posters rather than the rented list, Accenture is trading focus for reach. With many brands (shoe brands, for example), this trade makes sense. Every human is a potential shoe brand customer, so every human having positive feelings about Nike's products makes some kind of sense for Nike.

From a direct response marketing perspective, this tradeoff is insane.

But focus and reach and efficiency are not all that matter here. *Signals* matter too. Part of the signal Accenture sends by having posters and murals in airports is: "we're a well-known consulting company. If you happen to need one of those, you might contact us." This is the functional part of brand marketing's signaling.

The rest of the signal they're sending is: "we're doing so freaking well that we can afford to be 'wasteful' with our advertising budget. If you happen to need a consulting company, you might want to contact the one that is so big and profitable that they can spend advertising dollars wastefully." This _status signalling_. This is the same reason some services firms need an expensive office. It ain't because the fancy office makes the work better!

I believe but can't prove that the "no one got fired for hiring IBM" mindset applies even at the small end of the company size spectrum. So when our prospective clients see us using marketing that is somewhat "wasteful" (ex: taking time away from client work, getting on a plane and flying to speak at an event to share an impactful message), we send the same status signal Accenture is sending with their airport advertising and certain firms are sending with their expensive office leases.

### Broadcast platforms

Brand marketing often uses broadcast means of delivering content. In the old media world, this would be television, radio, and mass market print media like major publications and billboards. In the new media world, this is un-targeted or minimally targeted media like YouTube videos that are discovered through search or social sharing, talks at events, online publications, and so forth.

To translate this to the small consultant word, consider this: you're going to give a talk at a conference. Who _exactly_ will be there? Will any of them have the exact problem you help clients with?

You can't know this with any certainty ahead of time. So your talk at that conference is somewhat "un-targeted" compared to direct response marketing.

Brand marketing also tends to integrate with existing institutions. Just like Salesforce or iOS are platforms with public APIs third-party developers can use to build apps on top of, certain cultural institutions function the same way in brand marketing.

Let's say I want to get an idea in front of marketers. I have a choice of several institutions I can integrate with by giving a conference talk. One is the Inbound conference that HubSpot runs every year. I don't have to do the work of gathering ~25k people. The institution does that for me. I don't have to do the work of earning those attendees' trust. The institution does that for me. I integrate with the institution by knowing its norms, understanding what its audience might want, and using that understanding to tailor my talk to fit.

## Genre expectations

Just like direct response marketing has a sort of genre "feel" to it, so does brand marketing.

### Generosity

Brand marketing works best when it's done in a spirit of generosity. This is not unfettered generosity. There's still the background expectation that brand marketing contributes to a business outcome.

But at the same time, brand marketing exudes a feeling of "Company X is doing so well that it can afford to give back without needing an immediate return, and so the marketing that Company X engages in can be less mercenary and more generous and long-term in nature."

### Connection or contribution to the culture

Brand marketing is culturally aware. That's how it gives gifts! It's aware of what would and would not be valued by the culture, and so quite often the gifts that brand marketing gives are connected to what's happening _now_ in the culture. That's what makes those gifts relevant.

As of this writing in late 2019, a conference talk that makes sense of how the tech world could constructively handle events like those involving Epstein, the MIT Media Lab, and Richard Stallman would be a culturally-aware gift. If the talk came from a tech-focused consulting or PR firm, we'd understand they probably have a business motive in giving that talk, but we'd experience the insight and sense-making in the talk as an act of generosity, and one that is aware of what is troubling or threatening to the culture today. This cultural awareness increases the value and impact of the gift.

Direct response marketing tends to be less culturally aware. As well-known direct response marketer Gary Bencivenga put it: problems are markets. 

If the problem defines a culture, then a focus on a problem might be culturally aware. However, many problems are not cultures. 

Alcohol addiction has created a culture of recovery, embodied in the institution of AA. AA is problem-as-culture. But is there a similar cultural institution around addition to nicotine? Maybe, but not that I'm aware of. I've never heard of Smokers Anonymous. 

Many problems have no institutionalized culture, and therefore no cultural platform or institutions for brand marketing to integrate with.

### Aspirational focus

Brand marketing often has an aspirational focus. The US Army's "Be all you can be" campaign is a clear example of this.

Just imagine how direct response marketing would attempt to reach the goal of recruiting more people to volunteer for service in the Army. Direct response marketing might:

- Focus on how expensive college education is, and how service in the Army can help pay for a college education.
- Focus on how many poor or rural areas in the US lack job prospects, and how service in the Army can lead to acquisition of marketable skills.
- Focus on how socially isolating life can be, and how service in the Army leads to lifelong friendships.

The "Be all you can be" campaign _hints at_ some of these issues, but it does so in the larger context of an aspirational, uplifting message about personal achievement and transcending your limitations.

Brand marketing tends to shift the focus away from problems and towards aspirations or solutions.

### Action flows from affinity for the brand or importance of the message

Brand marketing will often _not_ make use of calls to action (CTAs) at all, and will generally avoid forceful or overly-specific CTAs.

CTAs may be present (ex: the "Be all you can be" campaign has a phone number at the end), but they are generally quite "soft" or "quiet" in tone. Here's what a soft or quiet CTA is _not_:

![](https://pmc-dropshare.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Photo-2019-10-06-11-01.jpg)

So how does a brand marketing message or campaign lead to the economic outcome we desire without using strong CTAs? In other words, how does it lead to the right people buying our services?

The answer to that question also partially answers this question: "when does a small consultancy transition away from direct response marketing towards brand marketing?" The answer: when you have something so important and relevant to say that listeners are naturally incentivized to take action _on their own_, without a forceful CTA.

In other words, brand marketing doesn't require forceful CTAs because the CTA is implied in some way:

1. The thing I'm talking about here is so important and relevant and my expertise is so obvious that you can "connect the dots", which means you going to my website without me telling you to, looking up my email address without me telling you to, and contacting me without me asking you to.
2. The thing I'm talking about here was already on your mind, and you were probably already searching for a solution, so I've just inserted myself into an established process you have for finding a consultant to work with, and the rest is up to that process.

CTAs may be present in brand marketing, but they won't be forceful. They'll tend to be placed elsewhere (closer to the point of sale, so to speak), not in the main body of the gift or performance.

### Time horizon

Another reason why brand marketing will often not have a CTA, or have only a soft, general CTA: the time horizon over which the marketing is expected to work is much longer than direct response marketing. Years; not weeks or months.

Over that longer time horizon, you may have produced a portfolio of gifts for those you are trying to reach, and the "residue" -- repeated exposure over time -- of that portfolio has created brand power. That brand power comes from you or your business name being associated with solving some problem, or creating some desired state. 

This time horizon thing is also why direct response marketing can feel so high-pressure compared to direct response marketing. It is! The results of a direct response campaign are expected in weeks or months rather than years, and one way to achieve that goal is to... apply pressure.

## Bootstrapping

It's unlikely you can use brand marketing earlier on in your career as a self-made expert. Here's why.

If you're a self-made expert, your transition from doing implementation work to advisory work almost certainly involves a bootstrapping phase when you are working to earn credibility and access to advisory opportunities. Your reputation falls short of your appetite for advisory work and so it's likely the profitability you'd need to invest in brand marketing simply isn't present in your business (yet). You won't be able to bear the expense of brand marketing. For example, travel to speak at multiple conferences each year may be financially out of reach, while reaching prospects through podcast guesting is not.

Brand marketing's avoidance of hard CTAs, avoidance of pressure (which signals need), and usual avoidance of a short-term focus on problems causes it to work more slowly. During a bootstrapping phase, you may not be able to afford to invest in this kind of lead time.

Finally, brand marketing tends to rely on institutions to help you distribute your message. These institutions earn trust by carefully curating who they put in front of their audience. As an outsider, you may have a hard time getting institutional acceptance or support. You're an unknown quantity. Furthermore, your message may run counter to what the institution wants to expose its audience to.

At some point, reputation becomes a "trojan horse" for a disruptive message, or a message in search of an audience. But before you have that reputation, what institutions will give you a platform? If none, then you need direct response marketing rather than brand marketing, at least until you bootstrap your reputation.

## Summary

At some point in the past, I remember mocking advertising with no clear CTA. I realize this was the product of a certain mindset that didn't comprehend the value of brand marketing. And I certainly didn't understand how direct response marketing almost inevitably comes into conflict with the expectations around expertise.

I don't mean to portray direct response vs brand marketing as a binary either/or decision. It's not. Even the "Be all you can be" campaign had a direct response mechanism at the end. And you'll find other elements of direct response marketing (like a focus on problems) in brand marketing. I recently saw a Chromebook ad that used humor to agitate the pain of not having computer backups. It had the tone of brand marketing (the gift of a quick laugh) but the content of direct response marketing (a focus on a problem, in this case someone dropping their un-backed-up laptop computer).

Eventually most self-made experts will need to embrace the tools and genre expectations of brand marketing.
