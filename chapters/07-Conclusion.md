Conclusion

- My not-so-secret agenda: support the cultivation of self-made expertise.
	- How I hope this guidebook does that: Gives you language and a conceptual framework for what might feel icky about DR marketing and a map out of that necessary state, both of which I hope amplify your focus on cultivating self-made expertise which is the ultimate fuel for moving from DR to brand marketing.
- Parting advice
	- I've tried to paint DR and brand marketing with a fair brush. The tools are neutral; it's all in how you use them.
		- That said, if you feel disaffected with DR, USE THAT!
	- Again, it's a transition, not a sudden state change.
		- The thrifty DR mindset can serve you well in the early stages of brand marketing as you re-use DR assets but with a brand marketing mindset.
	- I hope having a model for thinking about all of this helps make sense of the world of marketing. Don't let it intimidate you! The best marketing -- at least during that bootstrapping phase -- is marketing that also cultivates expertise. So more than anything, don't let new complexity stop you, because marketing-as-expertise-cultivate is one of the superpowers of the self-made expert.
