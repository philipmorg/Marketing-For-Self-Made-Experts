My not-at-all secret agenda is to support the cultivation of self-made expertise.

I hope this guidebook has given you language and a conceptual framework that helps you understand what might feel icky about direct response marketing, and a map out of that territory. I hope this framework and map amplify your focus on cultivating ever more valuable self-made expertise, which is the ultimate fuel for moving from direct response to brand marketing.

## Parting advice

I've tried to paint direct response and brand marketing with a fair brush. The tools are neutral; it's all in how you use them. There are experts I respect who use direct response marketing, but with a tone and style that gives them useful leverage but without excessively undermining their authority.

That said, if you feel disaffected with direct response, use that emotion to fuel a transition to brand marketing! Again, it's a transition, not a sudden state change.

As you do so, the thrifty direct response mindset can serve you well in the early stages of brand marketing as you re-use direct response assets but with a brand marketing mindset.

I hope having a model for thinking about all of this helps make sense of the world of marketing. Don't let it intimidate you! 

Progress is the new perfection.
