Set up the tension:

- You decide to "do marketing", you get shunted to DR tools
- Those same DR tools create a downstream contradiction you'll need to resolve.
- I don't want to help you do marketing here. I want to help you know how to think about marketing. That's the purpose of this book.
- Regarding that tension, there's a better way than crashing headlong into it: know what you're doing all along so you can steer the ship rather than just reacting
- This guidebook will help.
- It's meant primarily for self-made experts. We're the ones who will need to cross a chasm at some point from DR to brand marketing.
