Set up the tension:

- You decide to "do marketing", you get shunted to DR tools
- Those same DR tools create a downstream contradiction you'll need to resolve.
- I don't want to help you do marketing here. I want to help you know how to think about marketing. That's the purpose of this book.
- Regarding that tension, there's a better way than crashing headlong into it: know what you're doing all along so you can steer the ship rather than just reacting
- This guidebook will help.
- It's meant primarily for self-made experts. We're the ones who will need to cross a chasm at some point from DR to brand marketing.


## Definitions

My somewhat playful definitions of brand and direct response marketing are:

- Brand marketing: art with a logo on it.
- Direct response marketing: A button or form with a funnel behind it.

These definitions are constructed in a playful way to make them memorable and sticky, but they also express useful, serious ideas.

Let's see if these definitions help you with a quick quiz.

Q: Is email marketing brand or direct response marketing?

A: It can be either. It can be art with a logo on it. And it can -- and very often is -- an opt-in form with a funnel (fn) behind it. Even the same email list can function in both modes.

Q: Is giving a talk at a conference brand or direct response marketing?

A: Again, it could be either. It could be an artful sharing of expertise with a logo (your personal brand, in this case) woven throughout it. Or, it could be designed to efficiently obtain contact information from a segment of the audience and then feed that contact info into a funnel. Or, it could be both.

Don't get thrown off by an overly-specific interpretation of the word "art" when you think about brand marketing. I don't mean visual art, music, poetry, etc. I mean _an appealing or challenging gift to the culture_.
