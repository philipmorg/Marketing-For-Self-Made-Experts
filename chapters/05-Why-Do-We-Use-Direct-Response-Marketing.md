# Why Do We Use Direct Response Marketing?

We haven't explored brand marketing yet, nor have I laid out the conflict between expertise and direct response marketing.


Why do we use it, especially if it eventually won't serve us?

- The bootstrapping phase
- The efficiency
- The ease of use
- The path "in" for an outsider
- The noise
	- The marketing advice for small businesses leans DR because of the aforementioned reasons.
	- Brand marketing advice leans decidedly bigco because it tends to be less thrifty and scrappy
