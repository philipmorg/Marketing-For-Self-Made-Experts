# Why Do We Use Direct Response Marketing?

If direct response marketing eventually undermines our authority, why do we use it at all?

You'll recognize some of these themes from the previous chapter, but here we'll drill into why we make a short-term, utilitarian choice that won't serve us our entire career. 

## Bootstrapping

Self-made expertise is a journey from implementor to advisor. This journey happens outside the support systems of academia or the licensed professions. Self-made experts build up credibility, access, and expertise on their own in an entrepreneurial fashion.

This bootstrapping phase is a demanding time filled with hard, risky work and careful tradeoffs. One such tradeoff is between brand marketing, which poses no real conflict with the expert's authority, and direct response marketing, which does.

During this bootstrapping phase, we need some things more than we need the benefits of brand marketing. Those include:

### Efficiency

Direct response marketing is more efficient than brand marketing, and during the bootstrapping phase we need the leverage that comes from this efficiency.

To be accurate, direct response marketing does not efficiently protect the expert's authority. But during the bootstrapping phase, we need  a low-cost, effective way to reach those our growing expertise can help more than we need efficient conservation of authority. Direct response offers this leverage.

### Ease of use

Direct response marketing is easier for most of us beginning marketers to use than brand marketing. Assuming you're closer to the beginning than end of a self-made expertise journey, I believe you'll find the "d" version of the following couplet easier to execute than the "b" version:

1.d: Write a useful article on how your expertise solves an expensive problem for your clients, package it as a PDF, place it behind an opt-in form on your website.
1.b: Prepare a talk on how your clients' industry is changing and how your expertise paves a way forward for them, find a national-level conference to deliver this talk at, pitch the conference organizers, and do a good job of delivering the talk.

This is not the only example I could give you, but it pretty clearly points out the relatively higher difficulty level inherent in brand marketing.

### Side doors

As we've established, the institutional platforms that brand marketers use to distribute or amplify a message are often not available to those of us bootstrapping expertise. At least not in the early stages of our self-made expertise journey.

Institutional platforms are the front door. 

Direct response marketing is a "side door" that gives you direct access to an audience. Yes, you have to build this audience yourself. And that's fine because the aforementioned efficiency of brand marketing makes a smaller audience viable.

## Default status

We use direct response marketing because it gives us these bootstrapping-phase-friendly advantages. Efficiency, ease of use, and access to a side door.

And finally, we use it because it's the default.

I just searched Google for "marketing for consultants". Here's the advice from the first page of search results:

That's not a cherry-picked list. I could keep going, but you get the point. There's nothing wrong with direct response marketing being the default. In fact, it might be for the best given the leverage it offers.

## Summary 

Direct response marketing's default position leads to a myopia about brand marketing and makes it feel like, when the tension between direct response marketing and expertise comes to a head, we're trapped in a blind alley with no way out.

At the same time, brand marketing seems to be only for big companies using mass market media. It's not. It just needs to be adapted for self-made experts. There needs to be a defined migration path from direct response to brand marketing. The next chapter covers that.
