What is this brand marketing thing?

- What it is
	- Tools
		- Make sure to point out that brand marketing tends to ride on top of the "platform" of existing institutions. (I feel this but don't know how to prove it)
	- Genre expectations
- Why you probably can't use brand marketing during the bootstrapping phase
	- Expense
	- Lead/build-up time vs. need for quick revenue
	- Potential lack of institutional availability or institutional acceptance/support (outsider vs. insider status)
		- At some point, reputation becomes a trojan horse for a disruptive message, or a message in search of an audience. But before you have that reputation, what institutions will give you a platform? If none, then you need direct response marketing rather than brand marketing, at least until you bootstrap your reputation.
