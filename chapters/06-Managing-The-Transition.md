# Managing the DR to brand transition

- Remember: You'll probably start with DR marketing for the reasons articulated above. Simply put: brand marketing won't give you the leverage you need -- and DR will -- at a bootstrapping stage.
- A not-untypical consultant's DR marketing system
	- Email course or lead magnet(s) that collect email addresses and add those to a list. IoW, gated assets.
	- A way of promoting that/those gated assets
	- A way of identifying "the Terminators".
	- A way of fast-track selling to Terminators
	- A philosophy of using CTAs that effects the very design of your site
	- A tone in your communication that focuses on problems, perhaps in a somewhat heavy-handed way
	- Possibly: products or other digital assets that are part of a "ladder", these products possibly using engineered pricing.
	- Other detritus: landing pages, etc.
- Is the transition as simple as changing how you deploy CTAs, or simply dropping CTAs altogether? It might start with that, but I don't think it's as simple as that.
- Some marketing is ephemeral, and some is not. Your investment in DR marketing will leave a "residue" of various assets and the intertia of doing things a certain way. 
	- If you decide to do things differently, that residue and inertia doesn't just go away. You'll have cleanup to do.
	- Furthermore -- and you can trust me on this because I've seen the firsthand consequences and pain of ignoring this advice in my own business -- this is a transition rather than an abrupt switchover. If you treat it as the latter, expect an interruption in lead generation, or expect to begin a rapid switchover and find it to be a slow-motion, delayed, disruptive switchover because life happened at an inopportune moment.
- Practical stuff:

Then what? Again, that's why I wanted to write this. So you know what to do when direct response starts to become a poor fit for your business.

The first thing to do is to take stock of where you are. How exactly might the tone of your marketing be a tone of pressure, for example? The second thing to do is to resolve to avoid feeling shame or disappointment at how you've done marketing in the past. Those emotions don't help, and whatever you've done with direct response marketing might be what's enabled you to arrive at this privileged moment of considering a style of marketing that's less efficient!

When that moment comes when you sense you need to transition from direct response to brand marketing, what specifically do you do?

You might be able to strip out gates around content assets. That might be enough.

You might be able to change the tone of what you're already doing. The tone might have been fine and not need changing or, like me, you might need to alter it at a more fundamental level.

You might be able to consolidate a constellation of gated, small scale direct response assets into fewer more impactful ungated gifts. As a side benefit, you might be able to feel less stressed when you crack open the dashboard of your marketing automation software. :) You might have fewer automated email sequences to maintain, for example.

And there might be other easy things you can do, like dropping 3-tier infoproduct-ey pricing for products and going with more genre-appropriate price structures, for example.

So there might be some easy, more tactical changes you can make. And then after making those changes, things might get _way more difficult_ because you're ditching a crutch that you came to rely on, and now you need to further develop a new capability, which we could summarize thusly:

**Be able to get on a stage for 45 minutes with minimal or no props and no CTA at all and say something so impactful that -- assuming it's the right audience -- at least one person approaches you after the talk to ask for a meeting to explore working together.Â **

Your brand marketing may not make heavy use of speaking. That's fine. But if you think of the "impactful no-CTA talk" as a sort of litmus test, you'll be led to organize your thinking and points of view such that brand marketing will be a workable tool for you, and you'll be able to resolve that direct response-expertise conflict by lightening up on the direct response tools as much as your audience needs you to.

Another way to think of this...

Q: When you can let go of direct response tools and methods? 

A: When you can get on a stage for 45 minutes with minimal or no props and no CTA at all and say something so impactful that -- assuming it's the right audience -- at least one person approaches you after the talk to ask for a meeting to explore working together. 

You can think of it like earning your way out of direct response land.

You might not do the no-CTA talk. The specifics of how you do it might be different. For example, you might do a no-CTA _book_ that has similar dynamics to the talk.

But the idea is the same: you'll have a message that's so powerful that it drowns out the inefficiencies of brand marketing; it overpowers those inefficiencies.
