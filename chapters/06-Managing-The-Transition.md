Managing the DR to brand transition

- Remember: You'll probably start with DR marketing for the reasons articulated above. Simply put: brand marketing won't give you the leverage you need -- and DR will -- at a bootstrapping stage.
- Some marketing is ephemeral, and some is not. Your investment in DR marketing will leave a "residue" of various assets and the intertia of doing things a certain way. 
	- If you decide to do things differently, that residue and inertia doesn't just go away. You'll have cleanup to do.
	- Furthermore -- and you can trust me on this because I've seen the firsthand consequences and pain of ignoring this advice in my own business -- this is a transition rather than an abrupt switchover.
