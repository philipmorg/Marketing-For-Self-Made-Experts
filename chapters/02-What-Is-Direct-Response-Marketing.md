What is DR?

@TODO:

- Add these tools:
    - Long copy/sales pages
    - Money-back guarantees as first-order feature
    

## The tools

This won't be an exhaustive list, but if you see any of these tools in use, you're seeing some form of direct response marketing in action:

- A clear **call to action**. Ex: "To get the free bonus, send me your Amazon receipt showing that you've pre-purchased 10 or more copies of my book."
- A low-friction **form** used to collect signups or opt-ins. Ex: "To receive this free email course, tell me what email address to send it to."
- A **gated content asset**. Ex: "To download this whitepaper, please tell us about your company demographics and needs."
- A **low-priced product** used to measure buying intent and collect contact information. Ex: "Buy this $7 ebook and learn how to get rid of painful corns and callouses." 
- An **event** used to collect contact information that will later be used to promote something. Ex: "Attend this free webinar and learn how to $THING."
- A **sequence of emails** that describes some pain or problem, spends time vivifying that pain/problem, and pitches a solution to that pain/problem.

Again, that's not an exhaustive list, but it's one that I hope helps you recognize direct response marketing in action. While we're on the note of tools, we may as well look at the genre expectations of direct response marketing.

## Genre expectations

If we think of direct response marketing as a _genre_, then there are -- as with any genre -- certain expectations about how the form works:

- The ethos of direct response marketing is creating a 1:1 connection with leads from the very first conversion event, combined with collecting enough information to enable highly efficient marketing to that lead.
- Direct response marketing will intentionally or accidentally collect data -- the more individualized and complete the better -- about those being marketing to. As I mentioned last week, this is why the Internet is inherently a direct response medium.
- The goal of direct response marketing is to _get a response_ from those we are marketing to. This is the most fundamental, defining aspect of the genre. The "response" is not necessarily a sale. It might be some other kind of action: filling out a form, clicking a button, opening an email, attending an event, joining a waiting list, or the like.
- Finally -- critically! -- direct response marketing is focused on _problems_. This is not always the case, but very often the direct response marketing relationship begins with a conversion event (someone filling out a form, for example) that's focused on helping that person solve a problem.

## Tone

I have written some things I am not proud of.

Like I said before, I used to be an uncritical direct response fanboy. I got intoxicated with its ability to efficiently move the needle.

As a result, I can sorta of understand shit like this:

At this point in the article I was going to fish out some old copy from the archive of direct response stuff I've written over the years, and then create a little quiz to see if you could distinguish my copy from that of some genuine sleazeballs. But that got cumbersome to find examples, and felt a little gimmicky.

So let me just point you to one thing I've written -- that's currently still in place! -- that I'm not 100% proud of and plan to rewrite posthaste. It'll serve as a good illustration for the tone discussion:

In the above screencaps from <http://thepositioningmanual.com>, I've highlighted places where I yanked on the tone knob.

There are like, a million ways the tone of direct response marketing can be good, crappy, or used as a lever to achieve the goals of the marketing, which is really one singular goal: to get a desired response -- a button click, a form filled out, or some other action taken. So I won't be able to, nor should I, cover every single "tone knob" you can manipulate in direct response marketing. That said, many of you -- me included! -- benefit from using a certain amount of direct response marketing in our businesses. (fn) Direct response is, in many contexts, a useful tool. Since it's a mere tool, it's all about _how we use it_. And tone is a big part of that "how we use it" question. So I do want to talk about some of the more common direct response tone knobs.

### Urgency

Direct response marketing often tries to manufacture or amplify urgency around the recipient taking some kind of action. Again, the action could be a small next step, like opting in for something, or clicking a button.

Sometimes this urgency comes merely from the tone. It's not so much _what's_ being said as _how_ it's being said. A comparison of 2 made-up examples will help:

1. The room for this event seats 100, and 30 seats remain at the time of writing.
2. Seats for this event are going like hotcakes! We've only got 30% of the space left, and at this rate those seats won't last long. Claim yours now before it's too late.

Those both convey much the same information, but in very different ways. The difference is how the latter uses a more intense tone to manufacture urgency.

As always, what is "intense" is audience-dependent.

One of my favorite moments in The Simpsons illustrates:

Watch the whole thing for the full effect: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiF2PgHZNyI>

In one culture, the loud "intense" voices read as anger. In another, they don't. I know the Simpsons example is exaggerated for comedic effect, but it illustrates a true principle.

Urgency can be manufactured via real or artificial scarcity. Sometimes artificial scarcity, like the above example event with 30% of seats available, comes from obfuscating details that, if made known, would relax the feeling of urgency. For example, if some e-commerce site shows an available stock of 2 items, what does that really mean for me? Does that mean they'll possibly be out of stock for weeks if I don't order now? Or when they're out of stock, does their supplier easily have more for them in a day or two? Or are they drop-shipping and the whole idea of what's in stock is bullshit? By not revealing this information, I'm nudged towards fear of missing out and behave differently as a result.

What's hilarious and embarrassing is when a digital good is wrapped in some form of artificial scarcity, as if the maker couldn't distribute an unlimited quantity of that digital good. In the past, I've jokingly said I have only a few more copies of my (digital!) book The Positioning Manual available, hoping that folks get the joke and laugh along with me.

Amplifying the consequences of inaction is another way of manufacturing urgency. Calling anything the "opportunity of a lifetime" rings hollow and false when -- for many of us -- we are bombarded with opportunity from every side.

### Pain

A lot of direct response marketing focuses on _pain_. The pain of the problem the marketer purports to solve. The pain of doing nothing. The pain of the status quo.

How exactly that pain is described contributes to the tone.

If you look on the Internet for copywriting advice, most of that advice will be framed in the context of direct response marketing, and therefore most of it will talk about "agitating the pain". By this, those advice-givers mean for you to remind your reader about the pain you purport to solve, use vivid imagery to do this reminding, and find creative ways to bring that pain to life through your writing. They want your copy to be the "rainy weather" that causes your reader's "knee injury" to act up.

Of course, copywriters gonna copywrite, and some will greatly exaggerate pain points. The visual apogee of this can be seen here:

(This video had me doubled over in laughter. It's incredible, and I think it even has a brief cameo from Joe Biden. ;) )

One of the ways pain gets amplified in direct response marketing is to focus on the _emotional_ aspects of the pain. Direct response copywriters will tell you that _all decisions_ are emotional first, backed up by a post hoc logical process. That may be true. (fn) But the problem is not how decisions are _actually_ made, the problem is how we believe we make decisions. And if your audience fancies themselves to be logical thinkers, a heavily emotional tone in direct response marketing almost certainly will be problematic.

### Curiosity

Sometimes you'll see direct response marketing make use of curiosity. That's part of what I'm not proud of in my sales page for The Positioning Manual.

The apotheosis of curiosity in direct response marketing is the clickbait headline. Some examples, courtesy of <this article>:

- The Hot New Phone Everybody Is Talking About
- You Won’t Believe What Happened Next
- Watch This Video To Discover The True Meaning Of Life
- See How One Man Made $$$ In His Bedroom
- Health Insurance Companies HATE This New Trick

This kind of attempt at increasing curiosity is based on leaving out a critical detail to make something more interesting than it really is. Once you start noticing this technique, you see it every freaking where on the Internet.

I think marketers let themselves off the hook for using curiosity to waste people's time and money by considering the satisfaction of the curiosity -- rather than an actual benefit to someone's business -- as a form of value. "Clicking/buying will let them satisfy their curiosity, which is a benefit to them!" Sure, for a $10 book that's sort of fine. For something more costly I don't think that's sufficient justification for the misuse of curiosity.

It's also possible -- easy, in fact! -- to phrase a curiosity-inducing sentence or paragraph in a way that overstates the benefit in question. These kind of obvious overstatements might  be effective on rubes, but more critical prospects will have a negative reaction.

### Benefits

The final "tone control" relates to how benefits are described.

Are they described accurately, along with reasonable context about what's required to actually achieve those benefits and who is likely to achieve them? Or are they exaggerated or articulated in a context-free way?

Are the benefits described in factual or emotional language? Is an extra 20% in revenue an extra 20% in revenue, or is it a life-changing financial opportunity that will, to quote Tom Waits, "change your shorts, change your life, change your life"?

I've seen firsthand a situation where someone used direct response marketing with the benefits tone control cranked way up who then _blamed the customer_ if the customer failed to realize the promised benefits. This is lazy and unethical behavior.

I definitely understand the impulse to simplify marketing messages. Done correctly, this helps. It maximizes the chances that a message will penetrate and land in a noisy, somewhat chaotic communication environment.

Done incorrectly, simplification of a direct response marketing message leads to overstating benefits and stripping out too much context, leaving the marketing with an unrealistic promised benefit at its core.

## Persuasion

These direct response "tone knobs" all relate to one idea which, in the world of copywriting, is referred to as "persuasion".

There are just soooo many ways persuasion can be used well or slightly misused by accident or outright intentionally abused. 

Different outcomes here are based on 1) whether you are placing your client's best interest equal to or ahead of yours, 2) whether you understand the kind of tone that your clients will and won't accept in marketing, and finally (and somewhat speculatively) the time horizon over which you are thinking (desire for impact over a short or long term).

My guidance on tone can be boiled down to this test, for which I have Jonathan Stark to thank: "Would you do it that way if your client was a beloved family member?"
