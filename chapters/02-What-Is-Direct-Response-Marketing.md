# What is Direct Response Marketing?

Direct response marketing is a button or form with a funnel behind it.

It's useful to think about direct response marketing as a set of concrete _tools_, and also as a basket of less concrete ideas and feelings, which I'll label the _genre expectations_ around direct response marketing. We'll use that same lens to examine brand marketing.

## The Tools

If you see any of these tools in use, you're seeing some form of direct response marketing in action:

### A clear _call to action_

A call to action is a request that someone take some form of action. It can be as small as the "Buy Now" microcopy on a web page button, and may often be as large as a paragraph of text.

Ex: "To get the free bonus, send me your Amazon receipt showing that you've pre-purchased 10 or more copies of my book."

### A low-friction _form_ used to collect signups or opt-ins. 

Forms are typically used in direct response marketing to give people the option of joining an email list, signing up to receive a gated content asset, or sign up for an event. The underlying purpose is to gather information about that person, establish the beginnings of a 1:1 relationship, or find out where that person fits within a model of your audience (are they ready to buy or somewhere prior to that in their journey?).

Ex: "To receive this free email course, tell me what email address to send it to."

### A _gated content asset_ 

A content asset is something like a white paper, electronic book, or something similar. The "gate" in front of these types of content assets is an opt-in form, or a form that progressively builds a profile of that person.

Ex: "To download this white paper, please tell us about your company demographics and needs."

### A _low-priced product_ used to measure buying intent and collect contact information. 

Price is always a relative thing, and so "low-priced product" might mean anything from an e-book priced the same as a fast food restaurant meal all the way to a $2,000 seminar that delivers a taste of what a $200,000 consulting engagement would be like. The role of low-priced products in direct response marketing is generally either 1) to establish a financial relationship or 2) to collect contact information of more potentially serious prospects.

Ex: "Buy this $7 ebook and learn how to get rid of painful corns and callouses." 

### An _event_ used to collect contact information that will later be used to promote something.

We seem to be in the waning hours of the extreme popularity of webinars, but for quite a while we've seen webinars -- an online event -- used to deliver a small amount of value while mainly working to collect contact information that will later be used to promote something.

Ex: "Attend this free webinar and learn how to price your services more profitably."

### _Long form_ sales copy

Direct response marketing is often trying to eliminate or reduce the role of high-touch sales. If this form of marketing can get something sold without 1:1 human intervention, it's seen as a win.

That's why direct response marketing often makes use of long form sales copy. Direct response marketing is generally operating outside the infrastructure of established distribution channels and institutions, so the job of selling falls to the marketer, and direct response marketers want to do this selling efficiently at scale. To efficiently push prospects from unaware to aware to prospect to customer, long form sales copy is used.

### A _sequence of emails_ that describes some pain or problem, spends time vivifying that pain/problem, and pitches a solution to that pain/problem.

If you take long form sales copy, which is generally arranged vertically in a single very long column on a single sales page and divide it up into multiple emails, you have an email sequence that has the job of selling something, or pushing a prospect closer to taking some desired action.

### _Moneyback guarantees_

Lots of products and services include a moneyback guarantee. When you see a moneyback guarantee listed as a _primary feature_ of the product/services, you're probably seeing direct response marketing in action.

### _Testimonials_

A client or customer going on record with a description of, endorsement of, or praise for your product/services is a testimonial. Because direct response marketing seeks to build trust in a rapid and scalable manner, it tends to make use of testimonials. Testimonials in direct response marketing are used the way case studies are used in other forms of marketing. "See, this stuff works!"

### _Engineered pricing_

Direct response marketing, when used to sell something, often uses "engineered pricing". To an extend, all pricing is engineered to achieve some purpose: volume, revenue, or profitability. But direct response marketing often uses somewhat elaborate pricing models involving price tiers, bonuses, and so-called choice architecture or buying psychology. Additionally, direct response marketing will often use a focus on some painful problem and artificial scarcity to justify super-premium pricing.

If you see a price schedule with 3 or more tiers, often represented as columns in a table, then you are either seeing the price for a SaaS or a product/service with engineered pricing.

----

OK, that's our list of the primary tools of direct response marketing. Onward to the genre expectations.

## Genre expectations

If we think of direct response marketing as a _genre_, then there are -- as with any genre -- certain expectations about how the form works:

### 1:1 Connection

The ethos of direct response marketing is creating a 1:1 connection with leads from the very first conversion event, combined with collecting enough information to enable highly efficient marketing to that lead.

### Data

Direct response marketing will intentionally or accidentally collect data -- the more individualized and complete the better -- about those being marketing to. This is why the Internet, at its most fundamental, is inherently a direct response medium.

### Goal

The goal of direct response marketing is to _get a response_ from those we are marketing to. This is the most fundamental, defining aspect of the genre. The "response" is not necessarily a sale. It might be some other kind of action: filling out a form, clicking a button, opening an email, attending an event, joining a waiting list, or the like.

This idea of getting a response is elaborated into the model of a "digital marketing funnel". A funnel attempts to use a variety of techniques _over time_ to push people from unaware to aware to prospect to customer. At each stage of the funnel, some may not move forward or may leave the funnel. That's why the model of a funnel -- moving from the broad mouth to the narrow neck -- is used rather than the model of a straight pipe.

### Problems are markets

Finally -- critically! -- direct response marketing is focused on _problems_. This is not always the case, but very often the direct response marketing relationship begins with a conversion event (someone filling out a form, for example) that's focused on helping that person solve a problem.

## Tone

The genre of heavy metal music prepares you to hear distorted electric guitars, heavy drumming, and screamed vocals. There is a fun sub-genre of novelty heavy metal music. In that sub-genre, you have groups like Hayseed Dixie playing AC-DC songs on guitar, mandolin, banjo, and fiddle in a bluegrass style. The difference is not the notes being played, it's the entire *tone* of the resulting music. 

A big part of the genre expectations around direct response marketing is the tone used in the marketing. I think of these like the "tone knobs" on an electric guitar amplifier.

There are a million ways the tone of direct response marketing can be good, crappy, or used as a lever to achieve the goals of the marketing, which is really one singular goal: to get a desired response -- a button click, a form filled out, or some other action taken. So I won't be able to, nor should I, cover every single "tone knob" you can manipulate in direct response marketing. That said, many of you -- me included! -- benefit from using a certain amount of direct response marketing in our businesses. [^And critically, our clients also benefit from us using direct response marketing because it helps efficiently match their problems with our solution. If we were the only side of the relationship that benefits but it harms our clients, then of course we avoid the temptation of benefitting at their expense.] Direct response is, in many contexts, a useful tool. Since it's a mere tool, it's all about _how we use it_. And tone is a big part of that "how we use it" question. So let's talk about some of the more common direct response tone knobs.

### Urgency

Direct response marketing often tries to manufacture or amplify urgency around the recipient taking some kind of action. Again, the action could be a small next step, like opting in for something, or clicking a button.

Sometimes this urgency comes merely from the tone. It's not so much _what's_ being said as _how_ it's being said. A comparison of 2 made-up examples will help:

1. The room for this event seats 100, and 30 seats remain at the time of writing.
2. Seats for this event are going like hotcakes! We've only got 30% of the space left, and at this rate those seats won't last long. Claim yours now before it's too late.

Those both convey similar information, but in very different ways. The difference is how the latter uses a more intense tone to manufacture urgency.

What counts as "intense" is audience-dependent.

Urgency can be manufactured via real or artificial scarcity. Sometimes artificial scarcity, like the above example event with 30% of seats available, comes from obfuscating details that, if made known, would relax the feeling of urgency. For example, if some e-commerce site shows an available stock of 2 items, what does that really mean for me? Does that mean they'll possibly be out of stock for weeks if I don't order now? Or when they're out of stock, does their supplier easily have more for them in a day or two? Or are they drop-shipping and the whole idea of what's "in stock" is bullshit? By not revealing this information, I'm nudged towards fear of missing out and behave differently as a result.

Amplifying the consequences of inaction is another way of manufacturing urgency. Calling anything the "opportunity of a lifetime" rings hollow and false when -- for many of us especially in the global West -- we are bombarded with opportunity from every side.

### Pain

A lot of direct response marketing focuses on the _pain_ of the problem the marketer purports to solve. The pain of doing nothing. The pain of the status quo.

How exactly that pain is described contributes to the tone.

If you look on the Internet for copywriting advice, most of that advice will be framed in the context of direct response marketing, and therefore most of it will talk about "agitating the pain". By this, those advice-givers mean for you to remind your reader about the pain you purport to solve, use vivid imagery to do this reminding, and find creative ways to bring that pain to life through your writing.

Of course, copywriters gonna copywrite, and some will greatly exaggerate pain points. The visual apogee of this can be seen in this supercut of ridiculous exaggerated pain from TV infomercials:

https://youtu.be/qM4zMofsI7w

One of the ways pain gets amplified in direct response marketing is to focus on the _emotional_ aspects of the pain. Direct response copywriters will tell you that _all decisions_ are emotional first, backed up by a post hoc logical process. That may be true. [^Or this old saw about emotional decisions may not be true. I can't know without doing my own due diligence. Every time I get exposed to a supposedly science-based, surprising "fact" that can be expressed with no ambiguity or subtlety in a headline, I get real suspicious that the underlying science is flimsy or the translation to a headline has done violence to the nuance of the underlying science.]

The problem is not how decisions are _actually_ made, the problem is how we believe we make decisions. And if your audience fancies themselves to be logical thinkers, a heavily emotional tone in direct response marketing almost certainly will be problematic.

### Curiosity

Sometimes you'll see direct response marketing make use of curiosity. The apotheosis of curiosity in direct response marketing is the clickbait headline. Some examples, courtesy of [this article](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/buzzworthy-5-clickbait-headlines-guaranteed-annoy-ask-results/):

- The Hot New Phone Everybody Is Talking About
- You Won’t Believe What Happened Next
- Watch This Video To Discover The True Meaning Of Life
- See How One Man Made $$$ In His Bedroom
- Health Insurance Companies HATE This New Trick

This kind of attempt at increasing curiosity is based on leaving out a critical detail to make something more interesting than it really is. Once you start noticing this technique, you see it absolutely everywhere on the Internet.

Direct response marketers let themselves off the hook for using curiosity to waste people's time and money by considering the satisfaction of the curiosity -- rather than an actual benefit to someone's business -- as a form of value. "Clicking/buying will let them satisfy their curiosity, which is a benefit to them, even if the book wasn't all that great." Sure, for a $10 book that's not a crime. For something more costly I don't think that's sufficient justification for the misuse of curiosity.

It's also possible -- easy, in fact! -- to phrase a curiosity-inducing sentence or paragraph in a way that overstates the benefit in question. These kind of obvious overstatements might be effective on rubes, but more critical prospects will have a negative reaction.

### Benefits

The final "tone control" relates to how benefits are described.

Are they described accurately, along with reasonable context about what's required to actually achieve those benefits and who is likely to achieve them? Or are they exaggerated or articulated in a context-free way?

Are the benefits described in factual or emotional language? Is an extra 20% in revenue an extra 20% in revenue, or is it a life-changing financial opportunity that will, to [quote Tom Waits](https://genius.com/Tom-waits-step-right-up-lyrics), "change your shorts, change your life, change your life"?

I've seen firsthand a situation where someone used direct response marketing with the benefits tone control cranked way up who then _blamed the customer_ if the customer failed to realize the promised benefits. This is lazy and unethical behavior.

I definitely understand the impulse to *simplify* marketing messages. Done correctly, this helps both parties. It maximizes the chances that a message will penetrate and land in a noisy, somewhat chaotic communication environment.

Done incorrectly, simplification of a direct response marketing message leads to overstating benefits and stripping out too much context, leaving the marketing with an unrealistic promised benefit at its core.

## Persuasion

These direct response "tone knobs" all relate to one idea which, in the world of copywriting, is referred to as "persuasion".

There are just soooo many ways persuasion can be used well or slightly misused by accident or outright intentionally abused. 

Different outcomes here are based on 1) whether you are placing your client's best interest equal to or ahead of yours, 2) whether you understand the kind of tone that your clients will and won't accept in marketing, and finally 3) the time horizon over which you are working towards impact.

My guidance on tone can be boiled down to this simple test, for which I have Jonathan Stark to thank: "Would you do it that way if your client was a beloved family member?"

## Summary

You'll probably notice that much of the marketing you've seen on the Internet uses the tools and hews to the genre expectations of direct response marketing. That's because the Internet is fundamentally a direct response medium. What occurs most naturally when connecting and building trust with prospects online is collecting data about them and using the multitude of tools the Internet offers to push them through a funnel.

As a high-leverage, low-cost bootstrapping tool for the self-made expert, direct response marketing is a godsend.

As you'll begin to see, direct response marketing works differently than brand marketing, and can start to create more problems than it solves for the evolving self-made expert.
