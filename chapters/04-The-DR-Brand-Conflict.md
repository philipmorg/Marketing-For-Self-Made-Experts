# The Conflict Between Expertise & Direct Response Marketing

The genre expectations around valuable expertise conflict with direct response marketing. In fact, if you're a genuine expert who uses direct response marketing, you can undermine the perceived value of your own expertise. Brand marketing is largely free from these kinds of conflicts.

Let's explore why this is.

## Authority

Authority is expertise plus trust. [^I have my client Bob Lalasz to thank for this elegant definition.] Subtract either expertise or trust and you diminish authority.

At a certain point, direct response marketing corrodes trust. That is the "attack vector" by which it undermines authority.

## Expertise and Genre Expectations

Our perception of experts is that they 1) do important stuff that takes a lot of experience to do well or they 2) solve new important mysteries. Or both.

In the case of #1, expert marketing involves integrating with an existing river of demand and existing institutionally-enabled discovery mechanisms. [^A currently well-known institutionally-enabled discovery mechanism is TED talks. TED is the institution, and their audience's respect for TED's curation makes TED a useful discovery mechanism for interesting or compelling ideas.]

For #2, the expert starts doing the work themselves and the "marketing" is sharing what they've done with others who get excited about the expert's discoveries. This excitement leads to some form of investment [^The investment could be consulting work, direct investment, or other forms of monetizing the expert's work of innovation or discovery.] that sustains the expert's work.

There's an assumption at play here: experts would not invest in their expertise if there was not an important market need supplying them with plenty of demand for that expertise. Said more simply: saying you're an expert implies there's lucrative demand for your expertise. Why else would you have invested in it?

This assumption is why some who are *not* genuine experts *claim* that they are experts. They are hoping to hack mental heuristics to attract the kind of opportunity that genuine experts enjoy. The problem happens when these folks use direct response marketing. Their self-labeling as an expert sends one signal ("I have lots of naturally-occurring opportunity") while their marketing sends a different signal ("I need to use inexpensive, efficient marketing to capture every dribble of opportunity that might be out there, including opportunity that I manufacture through my marketing.")

A second assumption is at play in the genre expectations around expertise: the importance of the expertise is self-evident. Prospects will get exposed to the work and naturally respond because the importance is self-evident.

This genre assumption sets up another conflict. If the supposed expert is using a form of marketing that works very hard to highlight problems and pains and to portray the expert as a solution for those problems/pains, are they *really* an expert? In other words, if they were really an expert, wouldn't it be obvious that they are?

## Signals

Direct response marketing signals a need to sell something we wouldn't already buy on our own. This reads as unimportance (of the product) or neediness (of the seller). 

Direct response marketing suggests we are manufacturing an artificial sort of demand.

Direct response marketing also signals that the business is focused on short term transactional relationships [^Hat tip Frank McClung for surfacing this in a helpful discussion]. Direct response marketing often uses a tone of pressure, urgency, and even fear to push the recipient towards responding or buying. 

Our experience with experts elsewhere in life is that we have to seek them out, and once we find them they are objective in applying their expertise, and throughout the exchange there's the assumption that the matter at hand is *actually* important and so we will act accordingly and we won't need the expert to coach or motivate us to take action. The way direct response marketing uses external pressure to encourage action -- a short-term, transactional stance -- is in direct conflict with the normal assumptions around genuine expertise.

Do we want short term/transactional expertise? Sometimes, but generally we do not.

## Practical Issues

The timing, volume, and cadence with which direct response marketing is often delivered is at odds with the way senior managers deploy their time and attention. Colloquially: they're too busy for this shit.

Direct response marketing timeline expectations are also often out of step with the reality of the kind of people who would be economic buyers of world-class expertise. Colloquially: they're focused on big, important, long-term shit, not short-term transactional troubleshooting.

Senior managers have a multitude of concerns, but two are relevant here. 1) Time efficiency and 2) conservation of status [^"Conservation of status" means generally avoiding doing stuff that diminishes status and authority, and that means delegating certain tasks that are "beneath" the manager's position]. Both of these concerns make it less likely a senior manager will pay attention to direct response marketing. If they face an important decision, they are more likely to delegate what they consider lower-level research, get referrals from peers, or attend an event meant for them and their peers.

A heavy, high-pressure direct response marketing response tone amplifies all of these conflicts between direct response marketing and the promise of expertise.

## Why Brand Marketing Is Largely Free Of These Conflicts

Brand marketing is largely free of conflicts between our genre expectations of experts and the realities of brand marketing. Why?

First, a posture of (perhaps extreme) generosity is more compatible with the genre expectations around expertise. Remember our earlier assumption that some experts are solving important mysteries? They share what they've learned in the course of their "detective work" in order to attract future investment in that work. Experts doing this repeatedly over time trains us to expect experts to share.

A mode of sharing that uses more "expensive media" [^Expensive media might be speaking that involves travel, an extremely well-produced podcast, a regular column in a high-status publication, and so on.] is more compatible with the genre expectations around expertise. We expect experts to be knowledgeable enough about the culture they seek to impact (remember cultural awareness is a hallmark of brand marketing) to choose institutions, venues, and publications that can help them create maximum impact.

Finally, brand marketing builds trust in a more relaxed way than direct response marketing. Brand marketing usually integrates with cultural institutions that are already trusted, gives gifts that are more genuinely generous, and takes potentially costly risks that direct response marketers avoid.

## The Bootstrapping Gap

There's a good match between the genre expectations around expertise and the realities of brand marketing. Except for this one really troublesome area: stuff that's important, but the market awareness isn't there yet.

### Market Awareness

If we take smartphone penetration as a proxy for awareness of the usefulness of smartphones, in 2007 only 7.8% of the current market awareness around smartphones existed. Colloquially, 92.2% of the market for mobile phones in 2007 was *not* aware of the utility and value of a smart mobile phone. We might call this an un-aware market. A new thing exists, but the vast majority of the market isn't aware of the value of or need for this thing. It was quickly apparent to some people that smartphones had the potential to change _everything_. And they did in fact change so many aspects of modern life.

I routinely work with clients who face this same gap between the potential of their expertise to drive significant, sector-wide change for the better and an un-aware market. Additionally, these experts are generally in a bootstrapping phase. 

An unaware market [^Calling a market unaware isn't a criticism, it's merely a way of characterizing the market's relationship to some new thing they're largely unaware of.] is also one where the market's institutions aren't likely to be ready or eager to amplify a message about the new thing. Unless the institution is used to finding and amplifying these kinds of messages. The TED organization is one such institution.

Real but unproven expertise + unaware market + cautious institutions; how do you use brand marketing in this situation? There are 4 potential ways:

1. Walk your way up the "ladder" of institutions, starting with lower status ones with less stringent curation. Your message won't change much along the way, but you'll pay your dues for a while to earn the institutional acceptance and support you want to amplify your message.
2. Attack the margins. Blend a message an un-aware market can accept with your message about change or innovation. Titrate up on the innovation/change message as you can.
3. Use direct response marketing to gain momentum and build market awareness. In other words, bypass the culture's institutions and go direct to members of the culture using the tools of direct response marketing.
4. Build your own institution. You'll know if this is for you. Honestly, it probably isn't, since it's a formidable, complex, long-term play. [^I'm not saying you're not capable of this. I am saying institution-building might not be the best path to your success as a self-made expert.]

## Summary

Genuine expertise eventually conflicts with direct response marketing. Because direct response marketing signals need and manipulation, it undermines the trust that is so critical to the authority experts need to create impact.
