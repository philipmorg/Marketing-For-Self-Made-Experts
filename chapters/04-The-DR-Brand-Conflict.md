# The Conflict Between Brand & Direct Response Marketing

{NOTE: add in the idea of authority as expertise + trust (ht Bob L.) and talk about how DR can undermine authority by reducing trust, even though the expertise remains the same. This trust-reduction is the mechanism by which authority is undermined.}

The genre expectations around valuable expertise conflict with direct response marketing. In fact, if you're a genuine expert who uses direct response marketing, you can undermine the perceived value of your own expertise. Brand marketing is largely free from these kinds of conflicts.

Let's explore why this is.

## Expertise and Genre Expectations

Our perception of experts is that they 1) do important stuff that takes a lot of experience to do well or they 2) solve new important mysteries. Or both.

In the case of #1, their marketing involves integrating with an existing river of demand and existing institutionally-enabled discovery mechanisms. [^A currently well-known institutionally-enabled discovery mechanism is TED talks. TED is the institution, and their audience's respect for TED's disciplined curation makes TED a useful discovery mechanism for interesting or compelling ideas.]

For #2, the expert starts doing the work themselves and the "marketing" is sharing what they've done with others who get excited about the expert's discoveries. This excitement leads to some form of investment[^The investment could be consulting work, direct investment, or other forms of monetizing the expert's work of innovation or discovery.] that sustains the expert's work.

There's an assumption at play here: experts would not invest in their expertise if there was not an important market need supplying them with plenty of demand for their expertise. Said more simply: saying you're an expert implies there's lucrative demand for your expertise.

This assumption is why some who are *not* genuine experts *say* that they are experts. They are hoping to attract the kind of opportunity that genuine experts enjoy. The problem happens when these folks use direct response marketing. Their self-labeling as an expert sends one signal ("I have lots of opportunity") while their marketing sends a different signal ("I need to use inexpensive, efficient marketing to capture every ounce of opportunity that might be out there.")

A second assumption is at play in the genre expectations around expertise: the importance of the expertise is self-evident. Prospects will get exposed to the work and naturally respond because the importance is self-evident.

This genre assumption sets up another conflict. If the supposed expert is using a form of marketing that works very hard to highlight problems and pains and to portray the expert as a solution for those problems/pains, are they *really* an expert? In other words, if they were really an expert, wouldn't it be obvious that they are?

## Signals

Direct response marketing signals a need to sell something we wouldn't already buy on our own. This reads as unimportance (of the product) or neediness (of the seller). 

Direct response marketing suggests we are manufacturing an artificial sort of demand.

Direct response marketing also signals that the business is focused on short term transactional relationships [^Hat tip Frank McClung for surfacing this in a helpful discussion]. Direct response marketing often uses a tone of pressure, urgency, and even fear to push the recipient towards responding or buying. 

Our experience with experts elsewhere in life is that we have to seek them out, and once we find them they are objective in applying their expertise, and throughout the exchange there's the assumption that the matter at hand is *actually* important and so we will act accordingly and we won't need the expert to coach or motivate us to take action. The way direct response marketing uses external pressure to encourage action -- a short-term, transactional stance -- is in direct conflict with the normal assumptions around genuine expertise.

Do we want short term/transactional expertise? Sometimes, but generally we do not.

## Practical Issues

The timing, volume, and cadence with which direct response marketing is often delivered is at odds with the way senior managers deploy their time and attention. Colloquially: they're too busy for this shit.

Direct response marketing timeline expectations are also often out of step with the reality of the kind of people who would be economic buyers of world-class expertise. Colloquially: they're focused on big, important, long-term shit, not short-term transactional troubleshooting.

Senior managers have a multitude of concerns, but two are relevant here. 1) Time efficiency and 2) conservation of status[^"Conservation of status" means avoiding doing stuff that diminishes status and authority, and that means delegating certain tasks that are "beneath" the manager's position]. Both of these concerns make it less likely a senior manager will pay attention to direct response marketing. If they face an important decision, they are more likely to delegate what they consider lower-level research, get referrals from peers, or attend an event meant for them and their peers.

A heavy, high-pressure direct response marketing response tone amplifies all of these conflicts between direct response marketing and the promise of expertise.

## Why Brand Marketing Is Largely Free Of These Conflicts

Brand marketing is largely free of conflicts between our genre expectations of experts and the realities of brand marketing. Why?

First, a posture of (perhaps extreme) generosity is more compatible with the genre expectations around expertise. Remember our earlier assumption that some experts are solving important mysteries? They share what they've learned in the course of their "detective work" in order to attract future investment in that work. Experts doing this repeatedly over time trains us to expect experts to share.

A mode of sharing that uses more "expensive media" [^Expensive media might be speaking that involves travel, an extremely well-produced podcast, a regular column in a high-status publication, and so on.] is more compatible with the genre expectations around expertise. We expect experts to be knowledgeable enough about the culture they seek to impact (remember cultural awareness is a hallmark of brand marketing) to choose institutions, venues, and publications that can help them create maximum impact.

Finally, brand marketing builds trust more {TODO: what's the right idea here? Cautiously? Gradually? Respectfully? Broadly?} than direct response marketing. Brand marketing usually integrates with cultural institutions that are already trusted, gives gifts that are more genuinely generous, and takes risks that direct response marketers avoid.

## The Bootstrapping Gap

There's a good match between the genre expectations around expertise and the realities of brand marketing. Except for this one troublesome area: stuff that's important, but the market awareness isn't there yet.

{TODO: a few relatable examples}

 Notes: You have to create a bridge from the existing awareness to action on something new/untested/unknown. That's Seth Godin's "changing the culture" style marketing. The institutional support won't be there for this, so it suggests you use direct response marketing tools because those are often the default toolset for "outsiders" operating without institutional support. This doesn't mean brand marketing can't work here, it's just harder since you need to at least partially leverage institutions (ex: convince a conf organizer to let you give a different kind of talk).
